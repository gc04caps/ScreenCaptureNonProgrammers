# StreamCaptureNonProgrammers

All credit goes to markwilkie! I just took all his hard work and made it a bit more user friendly. 
Everything here assumes windows 10, 64bit. It will probably work on other windows environments, but no promises. 

See the official readme for more information:
https://github.com/markwilkie/StreamCapture/blob/master/README.md

You will need to edit these two files:
\bin\appsettings.json
\bin\keywords.json

After setup (editing the two files), you can start the program by clicking run.bat.

You can access the gui (while the program is running) at:
http://localhost:5000/home

Your finished (published) recordings will be placed in \ScreenCapture\bin\recordings folder

More detailed instructions can be found in Instructions - READ FIRST.txt
